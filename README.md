## Project Terms & Jargon

	- IVF(In Vitro Fertilization) is a medical procedure where an egg is fertilized by sperm outside the body, with the resulting embryo being implanted into the uterus.
	- Embryo is the early developmental stage formed after an egg is fertilized by sperm, before implantation in the uterus
	- A patient is an individual undergoing IVF fertility treatment.
	- Number of Previous IVF/DI Cycles: The total number of IVF or donor insemination cycles the patient has previously undergone.
	- Elective Single Embryo Transfer (eSET) is a process where only one embryo is selected for transfer to reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies.
	- Specific Treatment Type is the exact fertility treatment protocol used, such as ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection), FET (Frozen Embryo Transfer), or standard IVF.
	- Ovarian Stimulation is a process where medication is used to induce the ovaries to produce multiple eggs in a single cycle.
	- Fresh vs. Frozen Cycle: A fresh cycle refers to the use of embryos from the current stimulation cycle, while a frozen cycle uses embryos that were frozen from a previous cycle.
	- PGT-M and PGT-A (Preimplantation Genetic Testing): Genetic tests performed on embryos to identify genetic abnormalities before transfer. PGT-M is for monogenic disorders, and PGT-A is for aneuploidy (chromosome abnormalities).
	- Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, potentially affecting fertility.
	- Sperm Quality are attributes of sperm, including count, motility, and morphology, that affect the likelihood of successful fertilization.
	- Live Birth Occurrence is the successful delivery of a living baby following an IVF cycle.


## Business Requirements

Dr. Emily Davis, chief fertility specialist at Hope Fertility Clinic, has observed varying IVF success rates among patients due to numerous factors. She aims to identify key predictors of IVF success to optimize treatment plans and improve patient outcomes. Dr. Davis seeks to understand how patient attributes and treatment variables correlate with IVF success, focusing on the most impactful factors.

She is particularly interested in **predicting success rates for new patients based on their profiles, using a predictive model for more accurate estimations and personalized treatments**.

To support her team, Dr. Davis requests **detailed data visualizations to illustrate key variable relationships and an interactive dashboard for exploring data and making real-time predictions**.

## Hypothesis and how to validate

1. The success rate of IVF treatments is significantly higher for patients under the age of 35 compared to those aged 35 and above.

2. Elective single embryo transfer (eSET) reduces the likelihood of multiple pregnancies without significantly lowering the overall success rate.

3. Patients with a history of endometriosis have lower IVF success rates compared to those without endometriosis.


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks

* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

### Content 

- The Business Case is ficticious and was created with the help from AI, more specifically OpenAI ChatGPT.
